When it comes to programming I imagine a tool belt around my waist. Once you first get started you start to use and gain more tools on your belt. Maybe your first language was Python or Java but eventually as you continue to go through school and different experiences throughout your life, your toolbelt gains a large plethra of tools. 

I consider myself someone who "bloomed late" as I only started gaining interest in programming and coding in my Senior year of Highschool when I decided to take a AP Computer Science class. The class itself was extremely fun and I found myself both challenged and engaged with each assignment there was to come.

As the class went on I really felt like I was onto something with my life, it felt like I was called to do something I just didnt know what yet. This feeling was always so thrilling yet so subtle and periodic. Days where I learn a new way to implement something or learn more about the program structure itself. Even if its just anything small I learned and picked up on the way thats when I realized something.

The best part for me was getting one more tool in my belt.



## Learning Typescript

Currently im a Junior in Computer Science and so far I've got Python, Java, C and C++ in my toolbelt of programming languages. In learning all of those languages none compare to the way typescript has given me its first impression. When learning the languages I have, most of them share very common naming conventions and even have similar if not the exact same implementation of how theyre used.

However, in typescript im faced with a whole new system of how the programming language operates and is used. Sure a programming language still shares the main aspects of program structure but for me it feels like all of the syntax rules begin to blend together when im trying to work on something.

Regardless, sometimes when learning something new you have to break everything apart and start again in hopes to become stronger and better.

## What about C and C++?

Of all of the languages I know C and C++ are my best and most well known languages by far. Perhaps the bad impression I got from typescript derived from already having a refined foundation of knowledge of C and C++. By comparison, I see typescript as a mediocre programming language. Are there powerful tools? Of course. Does C and C++ also have powerful tools along with a more raw programming language capable of achieving exactly what the programmer wants? No question.

Nevertheless, one shouldnt be quick to condemn when they havent even scratched the surface yet. There is still alot more in typescript that I have to uncover before making a definite and actual claim.

## Will my belt see more tools from typescript?

While my first impression of typescript isnt the greatest one cant argue that there are useful tools and concepts in typescript that can be used in all other languages. Not to mention, typescript inadverdantly introduces new approaches to very similar if not the exact same types of prompts and challenges that other languages procure.

Some of the things that typescript normally uses are sometimes not normal or recommended when coding with other languages like C and C++. I feel like this really creates a new perspective and a new way to approach programming structure.

In this case knowledge is nothing more than another tool in my belt.
