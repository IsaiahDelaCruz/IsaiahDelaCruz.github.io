## The Problem

At the University of Manoa, students frequently receive a large volume of emails about internship opportunities, events, and other academic or career-related updates. While these emails contain valuable information, they often get buried under other university messages, making it easy for students to miss important opportunities. 

Without a centralized and organized platform for these opportunities, students must rely on scattered email updates, making it difficult to keep track of what’s relevant to them. As a result, students may miss out on internships, networking events, or research projects that could benefit their academic and professional growth.

## The Solution

To address this issue, we propose a **Discord/Slack-like application** where students can join different opportunity channels based on their interests and fields of study. Instead of receiving scattered emails, students would be invited to relevant channels where notifications are streamlined and easy to access.

**Key functionalities include:**
- **Channel-based system:** Students can join specific channels for different fields (e.g., ICS, Agriculture, Medicine) to receive only relevant updates.
- **Invite system:** Users can be invited to channels via an email link or invite code, making it easy for counselors, project managers, and recruiters to share opportunities.
- **Search and filter options:** Students can easily search for opportunities by keywords, deadlines, or categories.
- **Push notifications & reminders:** Unlike email, the platform can notify students in real time about new opportunities or approaching deadlines.
- **User roles and permissions:** Admins (such as counselors or professors) can post opportunities, while students can react, ask questions, or even share opportunities they find.

By creating this dedicated platform, students can stay informed without the clutter of excessive emails. 

## Mockup Page Ideas

To give users an intuitive experience, the platform would have:  
- **Home Dashboard:** Overview of recent opportunities and trending posts.  
- **Channel List:** Categories for different fields of study or event types.  
- **Opportunity Details Page:** Full details about an internship or event, including application deadlines and contact info.  
- **Search & Filter Page:** A way to browse and find specific opportunities quickly.  
- **Notifications Page:** A log of recent updates, so students never miss important posts.  

## Beyond the Basics

In the future, this application could expand with additional features:  
- **Automated Opportunity Matching:** AI-powered recommendations based on a student’s major and interests.  
- **Integration with University Systems:** Syncing with student accounts to verify enrollment and auto-suggest channels.  
- **Mobile App Version:** A dedicated app for iOS and Android with push notifications.  
- **Event RSVP System:** Allow students to RSVP directly within the app for networking events or company visits.  
- **Collaboration Features:** Discussion threads for students to ask questions or share experiences about specific opportunities.
