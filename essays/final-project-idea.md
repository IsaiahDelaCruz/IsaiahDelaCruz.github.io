## The Problem

Currently im a Junior in Computer Science and so far I've got Python, Java, C and C++ in my toolbelt of programming languages. In learning all of those languages none compare to the way typescript has given me its first impression. When learning the languages I have, most of them share very common naming conventions and even have similar if not the exact same implementation of how theyre used.

However, in typescript im faced with a whole new system of how the programming language operates and is used. Sure a programming language still shares the main aspects of program structure but for me it feels like all of the syntax rules begin to blend together when im trying to work on something.

Regardless, sometimes when learning something new you have to break everything apart and start again in hopes to become stronger and better.

## The Solution

Of all of the languages I know C and C++ are my best and most well known languages by far. Perhaps the bad impression I got from typescript derived from already having a refined foundation of knowledge of C and C++. By comparison, I see typescript as a mediocre programming language. Are there powerful tools? Of course. Does C and C++ also have powerful tools along with a more raw programming language capable of achieving exactly what the programmer wants? No question.

Nevertheless, one shouldnt be quick to condemn when they havent even scratched the surface yet. There is still alot more in typescript that I have to uncover before making a definite and actual claim.

## Mockup Page Ideas

While my first impression of typescript isnt the greatest one cant argue that there are useful tools and concepts in typescript that can be used in all other languages. Not to mention, typescript inadverdantly introduces new approaches to very similar if not the exact same types of prompts and challenges that other languages procure.

Some of the things that typescript normally uses are sometimes not normal or recommended when coding with other languages like C and C++. I feel like this really creates a new perspective and a new way to approach programming structure.

In this case knowledge is nothing more than another tool in my belt.
