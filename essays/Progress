When in it comes to programming I imagine a tool belt around my body. Once you first get started you start to use and gain more tools on your belt. Maybe your first language was Python or Java but eventually as you continue to go through school and different experiences throughout your life, your toolbelt gains all the neccessary tools. 

I consider myself someone who "bloomed late" as I only started gaining interest in programming and coding in my Senior year of Highschool when I decided to take a AP Computer Science class. The class itself was extremely fun and I found myself both challenged and engaged with each assignment there was to come.

As the class went on I really felt like I was onto something with my life, it felt like I was called to do something I just didnt know what yet. This feeling was always so thrilling yet so subtle and periodic when I was coding. Days where I learn a new way to implement something or learn more about the program structure itself or just anything small I learned and picked up on the way I realized something.

The best part for me was getting one more tool in my belt.



## Learning Typescript

Currently im a Junior in Computer Science and so far Ive got Python, Java, C and C++ in my toolbelt of programming languages. In learning all of those languages none compare to the way typescript has given me its first impression. When learning the languages I have most of them share very common naming conventions and even have similar if not the exact same implementation of how theyre used.

However

## What about C and C++?

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.
