When writing code usually the first thought that comes into your head isnt about how pretty your code looks or how nice your code looks. The first thought everyone is thinking about is "how am I going to fix my code?". That isnt nessecarily a bad something, in fact its something probobaly what every programmer thinks. This is until your future boss of your future software engineering job looks at your code and is in complete disbelief at how commplicated and unfathomable your code is.

Of course you show your boss that your program works and is producing the exact results that they wanted from the task. Then he tells you that the program youre coding is going to be used by a team of 4 senior engineers to build upon and improve features and functionality.

Following coding standards and using tools like ESLint isnt just about following rules and syntax or even mkaing your code pretty. Its about readability. What separates good code from bad code is structure and organization. Bad code is capable of achieving the goal while being completely unreadable. While on the other hand good code looks more organized, structured and even simple in some places where even some people that barely know programming languages can understand the functionality. 


## Day 1 of using ESLint

Upon doing my first assignment in Visual Studio Code with ESLint I was immdiately met with the color red every second I typed. It actually bothered me at times because I couldnt differentiate the difference between actual errors and ESLint errors. Seeing all of the red gave my one urge and one urge only, which was to get rid of all the errors so I could focus on the assignment.

Once I started to finish the assignmment I had gotten rid of all of the errors and noticed that not only did I finally solve and figure out how to do my coding assigment but my code looks very nice and well organized. I wouldnt say it made me completely surpised but it did make me realize the way Ive been writing code has been a bit messy compared to how it should be.


## Pretty code is smarter code

Aside from making my code more pretty, structured and organized it also gave me the realization of how things worked in my code. Generally speaking doing anything in life wrong helps you learn from your mistakes. ESLint and coding standards as a whole is kind of the life coach that every programmer has been secretly yearning for. It clearly points out nearly every coding standard error in you code and helps you learn the correct wway to write something. 

Maybe pretty code is smarter code
