summary: "The early stages of language endangerment in Palau, a research paper for LING 150C"
---

In my LING 150C class we learned alot about language endangerment and how a language getting shut down can mean the end of some cultures and even people. This paper centered on Palau and how from a Linguistic perspective is suffering from the early stages of language endangerment. While Palauan is still widely spoken, younger generations are increasingly shifting to English, raising concerns about its long-term survival. This shift is influenced by factors like globalization, education, and government policies favoring English. If this trend continues, Palauan could eventually face more severe threats, leading to cultural loss.

From writing and researching for this paper I learned that the power of doing extensive research goes a long way.  Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of only skimming sources or stopping at the first layer of research, but truly understanding a topic requires deeper investigation. Looking into historical, social, and political factors helped me see how language endangerment is a complex issue, not just a simple case of fewer people speaking a language. In addition, I learned that research is not just about collecting facts but about making connections between them. This process gave me a greater appreciation for the role of linguists in documenting and saving endangered languages.
