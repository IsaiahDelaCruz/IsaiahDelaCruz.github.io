## Overview

In addition, students will have the immediate opportunity to connect with other students and employers to grow their network.

## Contributions

For this webpage I focused on key foundations of the project such as the browser page, github project page, and attributing to improvements and fixing the system.

### Browser Page

### Github Project Page

### Fixes and Improvements

### Miscellaneous Contributions

Aside from the contributions stated prior, the project as a whole took alot of collective effort from each and every member. As for my minor contributions this included organizing a few team meatings, occasionally checking in on others with tasks, and also keeping all of our resources organized in both Github and Discord.
