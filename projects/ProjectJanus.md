## Overview

Project Janusâ€™s main mission is to provide UH computer science and engineering students with a web application that ensures that searching for internship and job opportunities can be as organized and concise as possible. In addition, students will have the immediate opportunity to connect with other students and employers to grow their network.

## Contributions

For this webpage I focused on key foundations of the project such as the browser page, github project page, and attributing to improvements and fixing the system.

#### Browser Page

The browsing page in Project Janus was made for students and companies alike to be able to browse through various companies and pick out specific opportunities that students felt catered to. The company cards in the browsing page provide details such as an overview of the company, location and as well as contact information for any student to follow up on.

Alot of my time and effort was mainly spent on designing the company cards and the browsing page itself. What was important to me was making the page look simple, professional and digestible for any user. In addition,

#### Github Project Page

#### Fixes and Improvements

#### Miscellaneous Contributions

Aside from the contributions stated prior, the project as a whole took alot of collective effort from each and every member. As for my minor contributions this included organizing a few team meatings, occasionally checking in on others with tasks, and also keeping all of our resources organized in both Github and Discord. Overall the little things matter most especially when working on a big project like Project Janus and each of my members contributed to the little things immensely.
