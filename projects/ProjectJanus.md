## Overview

Project Janusâ€™s main mission is to provide UH computer science and engineering students with a web application that ensures that searching for internship and job opportunities can be as organized and concise as possible. In addition, students will have the immediate opportunity to connect with other students and employers to grow their network.

## Contributions

For this webpage I focused on key foundations of the project such as the browser page, github project page, and attributing to improvements and fixing the system.

#### Browser Page

The browsing page in Project Janus was made for students and companies alike to be able to browse through various companies and pick out specific opportunities that students felt catered to. The company cards in the browsing page provide details such as an overview of the company, location and as well as contact information for any student to follow up on.

Alot of my time and effort was mainly spent on designing the company cards and the browsing page itself. What was important to me was making the page look simple, professional and digestible for any user. In addition,

#### Github Project Page

The Github project page was dedicated to introducing Project Janus as well the process of doing so. This came initially in the form of providing users with mockup pages of the webpage, an overview of Project Janus's mission and even addition resources such as team member info, links to project management, etc. Me and my team collectively worked on the project page; I was tasking with working on updating the User Guide's descriptions and screenshots whenever progress was made with them. In addition, I also split up the original User Guide to include both a student user guide and a company user guide resctively.

#### Fixes and Improvements

Project Janus didnt come without its issues. Me and my team collectively worked on ensuring Vercel deployment (with one primarily in charge of deployment) by making sure all files in the repository were without its common errors which would cause deployment issues. Moreover, I also made sure that the browsing page was constantly observed for improvement. This meant multiple version of the browser page being built on top of eachother, each being better and more improved than its predecessor.

#### Miscellaneous Contributions

Aside from the contributions stated prior, the project as a whole took alot of collective effort from each and every member. As for my minor contributions this included organizing a few team meatings, occasionally checking in on others with tasks, and also keeping all of our resources organized in both Github and Discord. Overall the little things matter most especially when working on a big project like Project Janus and each of my members contributed to the little things immensely.
