summary: "The Denver Nuggets win the NBA Championship, a paper and blog for ENG 100"
---

This paper I wrote for English 100 was a bit different than the usual essay and research papers you'd see. This paper was meant to mimic a real world blog post and or article that would be published righty after the Denver Nuggets win the NBA championship. The goal was to make it as sports-like and analytical as a normal blog post that you migth come across or even more so like something youd see on television.

Writing this paper was a extremely fun and intersting experience as it really got me to test my creativity and the lengths of it. I found myself enjoying writing the paper as I really enjoy watching the NBA (especially the Denver Nuggets). This assignment from my English 100 class made me realize when I get the creative freedom the difficulty of the task becomes less aparent and more digestible and interesting.
