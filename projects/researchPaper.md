The goal of the project was to mimic a real world work assignment by trying to create a bank database piece by piece with vague instructions each time. With the assignment being given with vague instructions and to many students there were many ways for the project to be completed but with efficiency in mind as well.

The bank database itself works mostly similar to how you'd think a bank database would work for your average bank, just on the lower scale with some security concerns being ommitted. When running the program you're greeted with a user interface and directions on how to use the program. The database saves the clients information and records if they decide to choose the 'add record' button and keeps the information stored after an instance of the program is exited. The program offers many more options to work with if its the users desire.
